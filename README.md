The-Mystery-Box-Solver
======================
@Author Jason Giancono

A program to give the optimal move for a state in the Warcraft 3 Mod Uther Party 2's minigame "The Mystery Box"

Also gives the option to output a graph of the minmax tree it generates, but this requires the python ETE2 which only really works out-of-the-box.
